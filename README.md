# _Reactive H₂S Stripping Column Model with CO₂ Hydration Kinetics_
A comprehensive Python-based simulation tool for modeling reactive hydrogen sulfide stripping columns with explicit incorporation of carbon dioxide hydration kinetics. This software addresses critical limitations in traditional equilibrium-based models by accounting for the slow kinetics of CO₂ hydration, providing accurate predictions for industrial process design and optimization.

## _Project Overview_
This project develops a stage-wise computational model for a reactive H₂S stripping column that converts sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) into sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) using carbon dioxide as the stripping agent. The key innovation lies in incorporating the kinetic limitations of CO₂ hydration to carbonic acid - a rate-limiting step that is typically neglected in equilibrium-based simulations but critically affects real-world performance.

### _Industrial Context_
- Application: Conversion of low-value sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) waste into high-value sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃)
- Process: Multi-step pathway involving reactive stripping of H₂S from aqueous NaHS solutions
- End Products: Sodium bicarbonate (intermediate) → Sodium carbonate (final product for glass manufacturing, paper industry)

## _Key Features_

- Error Handling: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and solution validation

## _Scientific Innovation_
### _Problem Addressed_
Traditional equilibrium-based models assume instantaneous CO₂ hydration, leading to significant prediction errors:

- Underestimation of required column stages at high recovery targets
- Inaccurate pH profiles affecting species distribution calculations
- Poor prediction of gas-phase compositions and flow rates
- Unreliable scaling from laboratory to industrial applications

### _Solution Approach_
This software explicitly models the kinetic limitation through:

- Rate Expression: First-order kinetics for CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃
- Temperature Dependence: Arrhenius-type correlation for rate constant
- Mass Balance Integration: Kinetic rate terms in material balances
- Equilibrium Coupling: Simultaneous solution of fast equilibria and slow kinetics

### _Key Findings_
- Critical Discovery: Kinetic effects become dominant at recovery targets >97%
- Optimal Conditions: 20°C temperature, 2.8 atm pressure minimize stage requirements
- Design Impact: Traditional models can underestimate equipment size by 40-60%
- pH Management: Kinetic limitations significantly affect acid-base chemistry
